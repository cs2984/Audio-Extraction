Audio-Extraction
================

You should see a binary file called mysteryAudio. This program iterates over the contents of mysteryAudio. The program will look through and locate an AIFF fileâ€”extract the file and save it into a separate file in your current working directory. There are five AIFF files hidden in mysteryAudio. The name of your new AIFF files should be f1.aiff, f2.aiff, etc. You can test to see if your program worked by trying to play the outputted AIFF files.

Within this project there is a makefile so that you can compile the project quickly in your systems Terminal by typing: 
make

Then to execute the program type: 
./audio 

You will see a completed message and within your directory there will be 5 decrypted audio files.
