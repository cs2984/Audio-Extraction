Audio-Extraction
================

You should see a binary file called mysteryAudio. This program iterates over the contents of mysteryAudio. The program will look through and locate an AIFF fileâ€”extract the file and save it into a separate file in your current working directory. There are five AIFF files hidden in mysteryAudio. The name of your new AIFF files should be f1.aiff, f2.aiff, etc. You can test to see if your program worked by trying to play the outputted AIFF files.
